Problem Definition:  

- Using Flickr APIs, create an application to search for photographs.
- User should land on a page with a search box, which should allow them to do the search.
- On searching, users should be able to view the photos (thumbnails), in a tabular format. The search box should disappear and a modify search button should appear in place of it.
- User should be able to modify the current search and do a new search. The old search box should appear again in place of modify search button.
- The search results should have pagination.
- There should be an option for the users to select how many photographs they want to see per page.
On clicking on any photo, it should open a popup with a slideshow of the images (actual size).
- There should also be an option to play or pause the slideshow, as well as options to self navigate and close the popup.
